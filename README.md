Where does open source come from?
=================================

Sometimes a [picture](http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/) is worth a thousand
words.

This interactive visualization of the location of contributors to the
top repositories on GitHub was my entry to the
[GitHub Data Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1450-the-github-data-challenge-ii)


Developing
----------

The provided Makefile has everything needed to fetch data from
[GitHub Archive](http://githubarchive.org), load it into a database,
geocode locations and output the resulting JSON. It can even push
the results to GitHub pages.

There are also some interesting queries for doing things like fetching
top 200 repositories, gathering up all the relevant events or getting
the unique set of locations to geocode.
